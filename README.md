# About the AI Agent
This project is a Digital Financial Literacy AI Agent designed to help users understand key financial concepts such as UPI, interest rates, budgeting, and online scam prevention. It supports multilingual queries and provides accurate, real-time answers sourced from trusted government and financial portals.

# Tech Stack Highlights
1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Implements an intelligent agent loop that reasons about user queries, selects appropriate actions (e.g., retrieving data), and observes results before generating a response.
2. LangGraph: Used to structure the agent's logic and handle complex workflows. LangGraph allows the agent to transition through states like Thought → Action → Observation in a dynamic, controlled environment. 3.IBM Granite 3-3-8B Instruct: Powers the natural language understanding and generation, fine-tuned for instruction-following and responsible AI behavior.
3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Ensures the agent provides reliable and up-to-date information by fetching content from verified sources during interaction.
